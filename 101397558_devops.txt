1. DevOps Philosophy: DevOps is not just a set of tools;
 it's a cultural and philosophical approach to software development and IT operations.
 It emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops)
 teams to streamline and automate processes.
 
2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): DevOps practices promote
   CI/CD pipelines, which automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. 
   This enables faster and more reliable delivery of new features and updates to production environments.

3. Automation: Automation is a central tenet of DevOps. It involves automating repetitive tasks, 
   such as code deployment, configuration management, and infrastructure provisioning. 
   Automation reduces human error, increases efficiency, and accelerates development cycles.
